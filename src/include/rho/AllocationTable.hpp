   * Special-purpose hashtable implementation for tracking medium and large
   * allocations.
   *
   * The table uses open addressing with quadratic probing to resolve
   * collisions. This hashtable differs from dense_hash_table by
   * allowing asymmetric insertion and searching - allocation ranges are
   * inserted but the lookup function searches on a pointer so the search
   * will look for a range covering the pointer.
   *
   * Another difference from most other types of generic maps is that this
   * hashtable will map a single allocation to multiple hash buckets - the
   * reason being that each hash bucket represents addresses that hash into
   * that bucket, and all internal pointers of an allocation must be able
   * to be found via the lookup_pointer() member function.
   *
   * For hashing pointers, we shift away LOW_BITS bits from the pointer before
   * hashing, and this limits the range of hash keys one allocation can hash
   * to.
